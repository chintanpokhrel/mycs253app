A simple clean blog written in Python and jinja2 for Google AppEngine (webapp2)

I did this as a Web Development Course project on Udacity.com.

It uses:

1. Google AppEngine for Python
2. Memcached for Python
3. Jinja2
4. HTML (currently there is no javascript in it, when I took this course a few months ago, I knew no javascript)

You need to install Google Appengine for Python (found at developers.google.com) in order to get started. Before
that, you'll have to install Python (found at python.org). 

I want to add page numbers, links to older pages and comments to each post.

Currently, all logged in users are allowed to post on the blog. I want to change it such that 
only some particular user has the write previleges.


I'm a newbie and I'm just scratching  the surfaces. Please do send pull requests. I'll accept them.
